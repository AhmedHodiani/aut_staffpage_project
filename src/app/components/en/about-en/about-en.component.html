            </div>
            <p>The information age has ushered in a new, super-intelligent economy known as the knowledge economy. When
                people traditionally think of economics, they think of it in financial terms. But in the age of
                information, people are talking about a new type of economy: the economy of brainpower.

                Think about it this way: You have one brain and it can only do so much work. How you choose to spend and
                invest your brainpower – that’s your own knowledge economy. You can scale this up to a national or even
                an international size and you have the global network of brainpower known as the knowledge economy.</p>
